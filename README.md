# Let's Git - Versionsverwaltung & Open Source Homework
Welcome to this homework for our MOOC. We hope you will have fun and learn a lot 

In this homework you will create a website on your favorite movie/book character! To start this excercise simply follow these steps:

- [ ] Fork this repository and open it in your browser
- [ ] Go to settings>rename repository and name it \<your github username.github.io\>. For example, if your username was sanjsp, the name of the repository should be sanjsp.github.io
- [ ] Clone the repository to your computer
- [ ] Set the online repository to your origin master (git remote add origin [link] -> confirm with git remote -v)
- [ ] Complete the issues on the repository site on github

When you have set up your website, then you will be able to see the content on \<your github username.github.io\>. If you want to see the changes that you've made on your feature branch, check out the index.md file in your repository on your branch. The website will always only display the version on your master branch, therefore changes on any other branch won't be visible on the website!
